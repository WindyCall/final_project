However the original problem intended to shift each character by k letters in the alphabet (e.g. 'a'->'d' for k=3). Thus while the code is consistent with our constructed tests, it does not meet the described specification; I therefore rated correctness as partially correct. Style is poor due to excessive wildcard imports and unused imports, little meaningful comments and noisy top-of-file imports. Simplicity is low because of many unnecessary imports and non-idiomatic code instead of a direct character-shift implementation; algorithm itself is O(n) but misleading. Robustness is poor: it doesn't follow the problem statement (alphabet shift), and edge cases around interpretation are not documented; maintainability suffers from import clutter.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "817ba6c1f622", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
