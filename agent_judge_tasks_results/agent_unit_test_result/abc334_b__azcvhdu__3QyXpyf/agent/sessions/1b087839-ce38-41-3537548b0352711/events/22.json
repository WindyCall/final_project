The code is well commented, readable, and uses a direct O(1) arithmetic approach which gives it high style and simplicity marks. However, it relies on floating-point division with math.ceil/math.floor which is theoretically fragile for integers beyond 2**53 and could produce off-by-one errors in extreme cases; my tests did not expose such a failure but the approach is less robust than an integer-only implementation. I recommend replacing float-based ceil/floor with integer arithmetic (e.g., using integer division or a safe ceil_div) to make the solution fully robust.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,200p' /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "a5b590bc047c", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
