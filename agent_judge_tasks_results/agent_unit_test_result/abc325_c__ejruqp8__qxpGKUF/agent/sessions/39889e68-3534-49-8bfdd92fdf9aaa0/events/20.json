Thus correctness is reduced: the algorithm counts components correctly but is vulnerable to stack overflow for worst-case inputs. The code is concise and has brief but sufficient comments, so style and simplicity are good. However robustness is only fair because it does not handle large components safely (would need an iterative BFS/DFS or recursion limit adjustments).", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,120p' /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "038c06a9d9b5", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
