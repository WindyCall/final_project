However, the algorithm is exponential and uses naive recursion/memoization over (pos, tight, need_seqs), so it will TLE or hit recursion limits for large N (constraints up to 3\u00d710^5), hence I reduced the correctness score. Style is acceptable: there is a docstring and some inline comments but limited overall documentation.
