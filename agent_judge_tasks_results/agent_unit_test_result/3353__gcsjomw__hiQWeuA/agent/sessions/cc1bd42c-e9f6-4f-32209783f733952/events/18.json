Style is poor due to many unnecessary and wildcard imports, duplicated imports, and an imprecise comment/docstring which reduce readability and professional quality. Simplicity is fair: the core algorithm is straightforward, but it uses O(n^2) substring membership checks and includes a lot of extraneous code that could be removed or simplified (e.g., build a set of reverse substrings for O(n)). Robustness is reasonable because edge cases (empty and length-1 strings) are handled and extensive random testing passed, but maintainability is hurt by the cluttered imports and slightly misleading comments, so it is not rated higher.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "cc9437cfa267", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
