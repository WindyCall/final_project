Style is weak due to many redundant and wildcard imports, duplicated imports and some noisy boilerplate in the provided solution (though small inline comments/docstrings exist). Simplicity is good because the approach is straightforward (binary search on y with O(n) area evaluation per step) and easy to understand, though a sweep-line could be asymptotically faster. Robustness is solid: the code handles edge cases tested (touching/overlapping squares, single-square cases), uses sufficient precision iterations, and runs in acceptable time for constraints, but could be optimized further for very large inputs.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,200p' evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "64c3a05ecba4", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
