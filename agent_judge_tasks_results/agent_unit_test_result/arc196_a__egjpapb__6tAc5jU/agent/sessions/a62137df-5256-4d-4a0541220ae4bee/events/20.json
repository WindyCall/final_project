However, the approach is exponential-time and exponential-space in the number of elements, so it will time out or exhaust memory for large inputs (N up to 3e5) and thus fails most real test cases. The style is moderate because the code is readable with brief comments and a docstring but lacks comprehensive documentation and input validation. The simplicity score is low since the implementation is straightforward but algorithmically inefficient and not suitable for the problem constraints, which also lowers robustness and maintainability.", "extras": {"command": "cat evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "a9eafc775076", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
