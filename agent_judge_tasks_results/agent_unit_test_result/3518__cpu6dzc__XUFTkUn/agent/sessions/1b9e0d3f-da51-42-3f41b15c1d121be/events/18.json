Style is low (0.3) because the file contains a large number of unnecessary and wildcard imports, duplicate imports, and extraneous boilerplate which hurt readability and maintainability. Simplicity is strong (0.8) since the core dynamic programming solution is concise, optimal (O(n) time, O(1) extra space) and easy to understand aside from the import clutter. Robustness is high (0.8) because the approach correctly handles negatives, zeros, and large inputs within the problem constraints, though maintainability could be improved by removing unused imports and using clearer sentinels instead of mixing float sentinels with integers.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "85ea299c401b", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
