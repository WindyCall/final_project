The code includes a clear DP approach and docstring but is heavily polluted with many unnecessary wildcard and duplicate imports which harms readability and style. The DP is simple, efficient (O(n^2) for n<=500), and concise in its core logic, though the import and top-level clutter reduce overall simplicity. The implementation handles edge cases and scales within the problem constraints, but maintainability is reduced by the excessive unused imports and wildcard usages.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,200p' evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "55e07fbd4346", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "/opt/openhands-venv/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
