Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: Sensors\n\nThere are zero or more sensors placed on a grid of H rows and W columns. Let (i, j) denote the square in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. \nWhether each square contains a sensor is given by the strings S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_H, each of length W. (i, j) contains a sensor if and only if the j-th character of S_i is #.\nThese sensors interact with other sensors in the squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to them and operate as one sensor.\nHere, a cell (x, y) and a cell (x'\"'\"', y'\"'\"') are said to be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent if and only if \\max(|x-x'\"'\"'|,|y-y'\"'\"'|) = 1.\nNote that if sensor A interacts with sensor B and sensor A interacts with sensor C, then sensor B and sensor C also interact.\nConsidering the interacting sensors as one sensor, find the number of sensors on this grid.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W\nS_1\nS_2\n\\vdots\nS_H\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq H, W \\leq 1000\n- H and W are integers.\n- S_i is a string of length W where each character is # or ..\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 6\n.##...\n...#..\n....##\n#.#...\n..#...\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nWhen considering the interacting sensors as one sensor, the following three sensors exist:\n\n- The interacting sensors at (1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(3,5),(3,6)\n- The sensor at (4,1)\n- The interacting sensors at (4,3),(5,3)\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 3\n#.#\n.#.\n#.#\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n\nSample Input 3\n\n4 2\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0\n\nSample Input 4\n\n5 47\n.#..#..#####..#...#..#####..#...#...###...#####\n.#.#...#.......#.#...#......##..#..#...#..#....\n.##....#####....#....#####..#.#.#..#......#####\n.#.#...#........#....#......#..##..#...#..#....\n.#..#..#####....#....#####..#...#...###...#####\n\nSample Output 4\n\n7\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nYou need to write code from scratch and solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" which reads from stdin and prints to stdout.\nTest your solution.py it\n...
