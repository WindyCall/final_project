Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-i\n\nGiven an array of integers called nums, you can perform the following operation while nums contains at least 2 elements:\n\nChoose the first two elements of nums and delete them.\n\nThe score of the operation is the sum of the deleted elements.\nYour task is to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed, such that all operations have the same score.\nReturn the maximum number of operations possible that satisfy the condition mentioned above.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,1,4,5]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We perform the following operations:\n- Delete the first two elements, with score 3 + 2 = 5, nums = [1,4,5].\n- Delete the first two elements, with score 1 + 4 = 5, nums = [5].\nWe are unable to perform any more operations as nums contain only 1 element.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,6,1,4]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We perform the following operations:\n- Delete the first two elements, with score 3 + 2 = 5, nums = [6,1,4].\nWe are unable to perform any more operations as the score of the next operation isn'\"'\"'t the same as the previous one.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\n=== STARTER CODE ===\nclass Solution:\n    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nComplete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" and save your solution class to that file.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1. Understand the problem and the starter code.\n2. Create a file \"solution.py\" in the current directory.\n3. Run '\"'\"'python check_solution.py'\"'\"' to test your solution with sample test cases.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all s\n...
