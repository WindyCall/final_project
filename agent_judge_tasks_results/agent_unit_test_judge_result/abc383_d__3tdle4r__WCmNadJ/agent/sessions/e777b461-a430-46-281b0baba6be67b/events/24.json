The code includes clear docstrings and brief comments for the two mathematical cases, which aid readability, but it lacks more comprehensive documentation for the helper prime functions and overall design, so style is good but not exceptional. The algorithm is simple and correct, but the implementation uses naive next_prime/is_prime routines rather than a sieve or precomputed prime list, introducing avoidable runtime overhead; nevertheless it completed the large N test in ~6.4s here, so I rate simplicity as decent but not optimal. Edge cases (small N and the distinct-prime condition) are handled and the code is straightforward to maintain, but the sequential prime generation and trial division approach make it less robust under tighter time limits or much larger inputs.", "extras": {"command": "cat /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "2d258d4fe51a", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
