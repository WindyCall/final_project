Algorithmically, the greedy two-pointer that matches the first ceil(n/2) elements to the last floor(n/2) elements is the standard correct approach for this problem, so I assess functional correctness as near-perfect (0.9) despite lacking automated runs. The code is well-commented with a clear docstring and inline comments explaining the strategy, but lacks module-level documentation and explicit complexity discussion (style 0.8). However, the implementation is inefficient for many queries \u2014 it extracts subarrays and does a linear scan per query giving O(N*Q) worst-case time \u2014 and it lacks input-performance safeguards and broader test harnesses, so simplicity 0.5 and robustness 0.4.", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,120p' /workspace/evaluation.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "41e7b29f3166", "working_dir": "/workspace", "py_interpreter_path": "", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
