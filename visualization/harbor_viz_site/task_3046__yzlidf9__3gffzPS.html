                <div id="problem-content" class="prose prose-sm prose-slate mb-8 max-w-none text-slate-700">You are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.
In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make num special.
An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25. Example 1: Input: num = &#34;2245047&#34;
Output: 2
Explanation: Delete digits num[5] and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;22450&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 2: Input: num = &#34;2908305&#34;
Output: 3
Explanation: Delete digits num[3], num[4], and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;2900&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 3: Input: num = &#34;10&#34;
Output: 1
Explanation: Delete digit num[0]. The resulting number is &#34;0&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number. Constraints: 1 &lt;= num.length &lt;= 100
num only consists of digits &#39;0&#39; through &#39;9&#39;.
num does not contain any leading zeros.</div>

&lt;ROLE&gt;
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like &#34;why is X happening&#34;, don&#39;t try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
&lt;/ROLE&gt;

&lt;EFFICIENCY&gt;
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
&lt;/EFFICIENCY&gt;

&lt;FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it&#39;s relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:
  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes
  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you&#39;ve confirmed your solution works
  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version
* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it
* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions
&lt;/FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;

&lt;CODE_QUALITY&gt;
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).
* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn&#39;t exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.
&lt;/CODE_QUALITY&gt;

&lt;VERSION_CONTROL&gt;
* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands &lt;openhands@all-hands.dev&gt; to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn&#39;t exist use &#34;openhands&#34; as the user.name and &#34;openhands@all-hands.dev&#34; as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn&#39;t go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
&lt;/VERSION_CONTROL&gt;

&lt;PULL_REQUESTS&gt;
* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
&lt;/PULL_REQUESTS&gt;

&lt;PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION:
   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes
   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
&lt;/PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;

&lt;SECURITY&gt;
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
&lt;/SECURITY&gt;

&lt;SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT&gt;
# 🔐 Security Risk Policy
When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:


- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.
  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.
- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.
  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.
- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.
  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.



**Global Rules**
- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.
&lt;/SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT&gt;

&lt;EXTERNAL_SERVICES&gt;
* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.
* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.
&lt;/EXTERNAL_SERVICES&gt;

&lt;ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;
* When user asks you to run an application, don&#39;t stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
&lt;/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;

&lt;TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;
* If you&#39;ve made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it&#39;s still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don&#39;t try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
&lt;/TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;

&lt;DOCUMENTATION&gt;
* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:
  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files
  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested
  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes
* If the user asks for documentation:
  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation
  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control
&lt;/DOCUMENTATION&gt;

&lt;PROCESS_MANAGEMENT&gt;
* When terminating processes:
  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes
  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process
  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID
  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands
&lt;/PROCESS_MANAGEMENT&gt;

&lt;TASK_MANAGEMENT&gt;
* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.
* It is crucial that you update task status to &#34;done&#34; immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.
* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:
  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`
  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units
  3. Update tasks to &#34;in_progress&#34; status when commencing work on them
  4. Update tasks to &#34;done&#34; status immediately after completing each item
  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements
  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding
* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:
  ```
  User: &#34;Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures&#34;
  Assistant: I&#39;m going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:
  - Execute the test suite
  - Resolve any validation failures
  I&#39;m now going to run the test suite using the terminal.
  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]
  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I&#39;m going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.
  [Updating first task to in_progress]
  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...

Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: minimum-operations-to-make-a-special-number

You are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.
In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make num special.
An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = &#34;2245047&#34;
Output: 2
Explanation: Delete digits num[5] and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;22450&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 2:

Input: num = &#34;2908305&#34;
Output: 3
Explanation: Delete digits num[3], num[4], and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;2900&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 3:

Input: num = &#34;10&#34;
Output: 1
Explanation: Delete digit num[0]. The resulting number is &#34;0&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.


 
Constraints:

1 &lt;= num.length &lt;= 100
num only consists of digits &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;0&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39; through &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;9&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;.
num does not contain any leading zeros.

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, num: str) -&gt; int:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file &#34;solution.py&#34; and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file &#34;solution.py&#34; in the current directory.
3. Run &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;python check_solution.py&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39; to test your solution with sample

        Find minimum deletions to make num divisible by 25.
        A number is divisible by 25 if it ends in: 00, 25, 50, or 75, or is 0.

Robustness_Score: 0.8
Reasoning: The implementation correctly checks all valid endings (00,25,50,75) and the single &#39;0&#39; case and computes the minimal deletions, so it will pass all test cases (1.0). The code has a helpful docstring and some inline comments, but the many redundant wildcard imports and overall file clutter reduce readability (0.8). The core algorithm is concise and O(n), yet the excessive and unnecessary imports introduce avoidable complexity and noise (0.6). The solution handles edge cases (single-digit, no-zero, delete-all) and is maintainable in its core logic, although namespace pollution from star-imports slightly harms robustness (0.8).

&lt;ROLE&gt;
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like &#34;why is X happening&#34;, don&#39;t try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
&lt;/ROLE&gt;

&lt;EFFICIENCY&gt;
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
&lt;/EFFICIENCY&gt;

&lt;FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it&#39;s relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:
  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes
  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you&#39;ve confirmed your solution works
  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version
* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it
* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions
&lt;/FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;

&lt;CODE_QUALITY&gt;
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).
* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn&#39;t exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.
&lt;/CODE_QUALITY&gt;

&lt;VERSION_CONTROL&gt;
* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands &lt;openhands@all-hands.dev&gt; to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn&#39;t exist use &#34;openhands&#34; as the user.name and &#34;openhands@all-hands.dev&#34; as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn&#39;t go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
&lt;/VERSION_CONTROL&gt;

&lt;PULL_REQUESTS&gt;
* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
&lt;/PULL_REQUESTS&gt;

&lt;PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION:
   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes
   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
&lt;/PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;

&lt;SECURITY&gt;
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
&lt;/SECURITY&gt;

&lt;SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT&gt;
# 🔐 Security Risk Policy
When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:


- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.
  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.
- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.
  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.
- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.
  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.



**Global Rules**
- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.
&lt;/SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT&gt;

&lt;EXTERNAL_SERVICES&gt;
* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.
* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.
&lt;/EXTERNAL_SERVICES&gt;

&lt;ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;
* When user asks you to run an application, don&#39;t stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
&lt;/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;

&lt;TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;
* If you&#39;ve made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it&#39;s still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don&#39;t try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
&lt;/TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;

&lt;DOCUMENTATION&gt;
* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:
  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files
  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested
  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes
* If the user asks for documentation:
  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation
  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control
&lt;/DOCUMENTATION&gt;

&lt;PROCESS_MANAGEMENT&gt;
* When terminating processes:
  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes
  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process
  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID
  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands
&lt;/PROCESS_MANAGEMENT&gt;

&lt;TASK_MANAGEMENT&gt;
* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.
* It is crucial that you update task status to &#34;done&#34; immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.
* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:
  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`
  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units
  3. Update tasks to &#34;in_progress&#34; status when commencing work on them
  4. Update tasks to &#34;done&#34; status immediately after completing each item
  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements
  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding
* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:
  ```
  User: &#34;Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures&#34;
  Assistant: I&#39;m going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:
  - Execute the test suite
  - Resolve any validation failures
  I&#39;m now going to run the test suite using the terminal.
  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]
  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I&#39;m going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.
  [Updating first task to in_progress]
  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...
  [After resolving first failure]
  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...
  ```
* Example workflow for component development:
  ```
  User: &#34;Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options&#34;
  Assistant: I&#39;ll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.
  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:
  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements
  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture
  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity
  4. Create filtering and search functionality
  5. Integrate components and perform testing
  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we&#39;re working with...
  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]
  ```
&lt;/TASK_MANAGEMENT&gt;

&lt;TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE&gt;
* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation
* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity
* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them

Your task is to evaluate the CORRECTNESS of the following code solution.

**Problem:**
Title: minimum-operations-to-make-a-special-number

You are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.
In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make num special.
An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = &#34;2245047&#34;
Output: 2
Explanation: Delete digits num[5] and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;22450&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 2:

Input: num = &#34;2908305&#34;
Output: 3
Explanation: Delete digits num[3], num[4], and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;2900&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 3:

Input: num = &#34;10&#34;
Output: 1
Explanation: Delete digit num[0]. The resulting number is &#34;0&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.


 
Constraints:

1 &lt;= num.length &lt;= 100
num only consists of digits &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;0&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39; through &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;9&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;.
num does not contain any leading zeros.

=== STARTER CODE ===

    def minimumOperations(self, num: str) -&gt; int:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file &#34;solution.py&#34; and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.
2. Create a file &#34;solution.py&#34; in the current directory.
3. Run &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;python check_solution.py&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39; to test your solution with sample

        Find minimum deletions to make num divisible by 25.
        A number is divisible by 25 if it ends in: 00, 25, 50, or 75, or is 0.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        n = len(num)

&lt;ROLE&gt;
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like &#34;why is X happening&#34;, don&#39;t try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
&lt;/ROLE&gt;

&lt;EFFICIENCY&gt;
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
&lt;/EFFICIENCY&gt;

&lt;FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it&#39;s relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:
  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes
  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you&#39;ve confirmed your solution works
  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version
* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it
* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions
&lt;/FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;

&lt;CODE_QUALITY&gt;
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).
* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn&#39;t exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.
&lt;/CODE_QUALITY&gt;

&lt;VERSION_CONTROL&gt;
* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands &lt;openhands@all-hands.dev&gt; to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn&#39;t exist use &#34;openhands&#34; as the user.name and &#34;openhands@all-hands.dev&#34; as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn&#39;t go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
&lt;/VERSION_CONTROL&gt;

&lt;PULL_REQUESTS&gt;
* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
&lt;/PULL_REQUESTS&gt;

&lt;PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION:
   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes
   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
&lt;/PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;

&lt;SECURITY&gt;
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
&lt;/SECURITY&gt;

&lt;SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT&gt;
# 🔐 Security Risk Policy
When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:


- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.
  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.
- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.
  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.
- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.
  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.



**Global Rules**
- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.
&lt;/SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT&gt;

&lt;EXTERNAL_SERVICES&gt;
* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.
* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.
&lt;/EXTERNAL_SERVICES&gt;

&lt;ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;
* When user asks you to run an application, don&#39;t stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
&lt;/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;

&lt;TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;
* If you&#39;ve made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it&#39;s still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don&#39;t try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
&lt;/TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;

&lt;DOCUMENTATION&gt;
* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:
  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files
  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested
  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes
* If the user asks for documentation:
  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation
  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control
&lt;/DOCUMENTATION&gt;

&lt;PROCESS_MANAGEMENT&gt;
* When terminating processes:
  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes
  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process
  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID
  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands
&lt;/PROCESS_MANAGEMENT&gt;

&lt;TASK_MANAGEMENT&gt;
* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.
* It is crucial that you update task status to &#34;done&#34; immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.
* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:
  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`
  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units
  3. Update tasks to &#34;in_progress&#34; status when commencing work on them
  4. Update tasks to &#34;done&#34; status immediately after completing each item
  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements
  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding
* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:
  ```
  User: &#34;Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures&#34;
  Assistant: I&#39;m going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:
  - Execute the test suite
  - Resolve any validation failures
  I&#39;m now going to run the test suite using the terminal.
  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]
  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I&#39;m going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.
  [Updating first task to in_progress]
  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...
  [After resolving first failure]
  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...
  ```
* Example workflow for component development:
  ```
  User: &#34;Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options&#34;
  Assistant: I&#39;ll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.
  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:
  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements
  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture
  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity
  4. Create filtering and search functionality
  5. Integrate components and perform testing
  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we&#39;re working with...
  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]
  ```
&lt;/TASK_MANAGEMENT&gt;

&lt;TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE&gt;
* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation
* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity
* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them

Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: minimum-operations-to-make-a-special-number

You are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.
In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make num special.
An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = &#34;2245047&#34;
Output: 2
Explanation: Delete digits num[5] and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;22450&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 2:

Input: num = &#34;2908305&#34;
Output: 3
Explanation: Delete digits num[3], num[4], and num[6]. The resulting number is &#34;2900&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.
Example 3:

Input: num = &#34;10&#34;
Output: 1
Explanation: Delete digit num[0]. The resulting number is &#34;0&#34; which is special since it is divisible by 25.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum number of operations required to get a special number.


 
Constraints:

1 &lt;= num.length &lt;= 100
num only consists of digits &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;0&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39; through &#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;9&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;.
num does not contain any leading zeros.

=== STARTER CODE ===
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, num: str) -&gt; int:

=== YOUR TASK ===
Complete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.
You must use tools to create a file &#34;solution.py&#34; and save your solution class to that file.
Test your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it&#39;&#34;&#39;&#34;&#39;s correct.
There is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.

=== STEP GUIDE ===
1. Understand the problem and the starter code.

**Aspect 1: CORRECTNESS (Functional Correctness)**

To evaluate correctness, you MUST create and execute unit test cases to validate the solution.

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Completely correct - passed ALL test cases (100%)
- 0.9: Nearly perfect - passed ~90% of test cases, minor edge case issues
- 0.8: Mostly correct - passed ~80% of test cases, some edge cases fail
- 0.7: Largely correct - passed ~70% of test cases, notable gaps
- 0.6: Somewhat correct - passed ~60% of test cases, significant issues
- 0.5: Partially correct - passed ~50% of test cases, major flaws
- 0.4: Limited correctness - passed ~40% of test cases
- 0.3: Mostly incorrect - passed ~30% of test cases
- 0.2: Largely incorrect - passed ~20% of test cases
- 0.1: Nearly all wrong - passed ~10% of test cases
- 0.0: Completely incorrect - passed 0% of test cases

**Aspect 2: STYLE (Code Comments &amp; Documentation)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - comprehensive comments, clear documentation
- 0.7-0.9: Good - adequate comments on key sections
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - minimal comments, some sections unclear
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - no comments or very poor documentation

**Aspect 3: SIMPLICITY (Code Efficiency &amp; Conciseness)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - clean, efficient, no unnecessary operations
- 0.7-0.9: Good - mostly concise with minor redundancies
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - some unnecessary complexity or redundant code
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - overly complex with many unnecessary operations

**Aspect 4: ROBUSTNESS (Maintainability &amp; Edge Case Handling)**

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0: Excellent - handles all edge cases, highly maintainable, extendable
- 0.7-0.9: Good - handles most edge cases, reasonably maintainable
- 0.4-0.6: Fair - missing some edge cases, harder to maintain
- 0.0-0.3: Poor - poor edge case handling, difficult to maintain/extend

**Required Action:**
Create a file called `evaluation.txt` with your evaluation in the following format:
```
Correctness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Style_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Simplicity_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Robustness_Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining your scores for each aspect, with specific reference to test results for correctness]
```

Do not provide any other output. Only create the evaluation.txt file.</div></div>

      &#34;content&#34;: &#34;Correctness_Score: 1.0\nStyle_Score: 0.4\nSimplicity_Score: 0.8\nRobustness_Score: 0.8\nReasoning: The implementation is functionally correct — it passed all automated checks I ran (1016 tests total: several deterministic cases plus 1000 randomized small-case brute-force comparisons). Style is penalized because the file contains a large number of unnecessary and duplicate imports which harms readability and maintainability despite reasonable inline comments. Simplicity is good because the algorithm is straightforward, efficient for the input limits (O(n^2) with n&lt;=100), and uses minimal logic to check the four valid endings. Robustness is strong: edge cases (single digit, zeros, deleting all digits to get 0) are handled and verified by the tests, though maintainability could be improved by removing dead imports and simplifying module-level clutter.&#34;
