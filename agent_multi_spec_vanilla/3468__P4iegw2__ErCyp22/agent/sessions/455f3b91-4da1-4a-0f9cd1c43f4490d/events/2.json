Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.\n\n**Problem:**\nTitle: find-the-encrypted-string\n\nYou are given a string s and an integer k. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:\n\nFor each character c in s, replace c with the k^th character after c in the string (in a cyclic manner).\n\nReturn the encrypted string.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"dart\", k = 3\nOutput: \"tdar\"\nExplanation:\n\nFor i = 0, the 3^rd character after '\"'\"'d'\"'\"' is '\"'\"'t'\"'\"'.\nFor i = 1, the 3^rd character after '\"'\"'a'\"'\"' is '\"'\"'d'\"'\"'.\nFor i = 2, the 3^rd character after '\"'\"'r'\"'\"' is '\"'\"'a'\"'\"'.\nFor i = 3, the 3^rd character after '\"'\"'t'\"'\"' is '\"'\"'r'\"'\"'.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aaa\", k = 1\nOutput: \"aaa\"\nExplanation:\nAs all the characters are the same, the encrypted string will also be the same.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 100\n1 <= k <= 10^4\ns consists only of lowercase English letters.\n\n=== STARTER CODE ===\nclass Solution:\n    def getEncryptedString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n\n=== YOUR TASK ===\nComplete the Solution class in the starter code to solve the problem.\nYou must use tools to create a file \"solution.py\" and save your solution class to that file.\nTest your solution.py iteratively with a program called check_solution.py under the same directory, and iterate until it'\"'\"'s correct.\nThere is a time limit on each test case, so be careful about the efficiency of your solution.\n\n=== STEP GUIDE ===\n1. Understand the problem and the starter code.\n2. Create a file \"solution.py\" in the current directory.\n3. Run '\"'\"'python check_solution.py'\"'\"' to test your solution with sample test cases.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and update your solution.py file.\n5.
